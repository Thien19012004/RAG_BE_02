  "The image presents a detailed flowchart illustrating the process involved in querying and gathering information using transformer architecture, specifically focusing on a system labeled as \"Agent LLM.\" \n\n### Structure and Components:\n\n1. **Input Query:** \n   - Located at the leftmost side, labeled \"Input Query,\" where users input their search queries.\n\n2. **Search Section:**\n   - Positioned in a blue rectangular box, this section encompasses several elements:\n     - **Keywords & Years:** Identifies the search parameters.\n     - **Available APIs:** Refers to potential sources for fetching data.\n     - **Top K Results:** Indicates a filter for selecting the top results based on the search.\n     - **Papers Found & Status:** A representation of the documents retrieved and their corresponding status.\n\n3. **Gather Evidence Section:**\n   - This area, also in a blue box, focuses on processing and retrieving deeper information:\n     - **Embedded Chunks:** Refers to sections of text or data that have been transformed into embeddings for better analysis.\n     - **MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) Vector Retrieval:** A method used for selecting the most relevant chunks of information.\n     - **LLM Relevance Score:** Assesses the relevance of the embedded question to the gathered evidence.\n     - **Top M Chunks:** The resulting most relevant pieces of information after processing.\n\n4. **Answer Question Section:**\n   - Highlighted in pink, this section illustrates the core lifecycle of answering the query:\n     - **Question:** Where the user’s query is articulated.\n     - **Ask LLM:** A decision point where the system queries the language model about the question.\n     - **Context Library:** Utilizes a repository of context or knowledge to inform the response.\n     - **Propose Answer:** The LLM suggests an answer based on its understanding and the provided context.\n     - **Show to Agent:** The proposed answer is presented back to the main system for further consideration.\n     - **Continue Answering:** Indicates the possibility of further refinement if the answer is incomplete or insufficient.\n\n5. **Agent LLM:**\n   - Centrally located, this key element integrates the processes from both searching and answering questions, functioning as the core engine driving the retrieval and response mechanism.\n\n6. **Query Answer:**\n   - Positioned at the far right, the flow culminates with either continuing the answering process or, if sufficient, providing the final answer to the user’s query.\n\n### Design and Annotations:\n- The overall design is organized with clear modular components and directional arrows indicating the flow of data and processes.\n- The use of different colored boxes helps distinguish between various sections and functionalities, enhancing readability and understanding of the architecture.\n- Arrows between blocks illustrate the pathway and transitions from gathering information to proposing and finalizing an answer.\n\nThis flowchart effectively illustrates the steps involved in using transformers for retrieving and processing information based on user input, emphasizing the roles of both the search and evidence-gathering stages in generating accurate responses.",
  "The image features a probability plot that illustrates the relationship between the number of keyword searches and the probability for three different search methods: Google, Semantic, and CORE.\n\n1. **Axes**:\n   - The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the \"Number of Keyword Searches,\" ranging from 0 to 20.\n   - The vertical axis (y-axis) shows \"Probability,\" with values ranging from 0 to 1.\n\n2. **Data Representation**:\n   - The plot uses **dotted lines** to represent the three different methods:\n     - **Google** is depicted in a green dotted line. This line rises quickly and levels off at a high probability, indicating that Google reaches a near certainty in results with fewer searches.\n     - **Semantic** is shown in an orange dotted line. This line also increases steadily but reaches its peak more gradually, yielding a probability slightly below that of Google.\n     - **CORE** is portrayed with a blue dotted line. This line has the slowest ascent and remains at a lower probability compared to the other two methods.\n\n3. **Legend**:\n   - The legend in the upper left corner clarifies which color corresponds to which method, with each entry matching the respective color of the lines in the plot.\n\nOverall, the graph effectively illustrates how the probability of finding the expected results changes with the number of keyword searches across different methodologies, showcasing varying efficiency and performance levels.",
  "The image presents a plot illustrating the probabilities associated with different types of keyword searches as the number of searches increases from 0 to 20. \n\n### Axes:\n- **X-Axis**: Labeled as \"Number of Keyword Searches,\" it ranges from 0 to 20.\n- **Y-Axis**: Labeled as \"Probability,\" it ranges from 0.0 to 0.8.\n\n### Data Series:\nThe plot contains four distinct data series, each represented by a different color and line style:\n\n1. **Google** (solid line, teal color): This series starts at a low probability and increases steadily, approaching 0.8 as the number of searches increases. The lines show a smooth upward trend, suggesting a high effectiveness with more searches.\n  \n2. **Semantic** (dotted line, orange color): This series has a comparatively gradual increase, beginning at a lower probability and leveling off at around 0.6 after multiple searches. The dotted line suggests variability in the effectiveness over time.\n  \n3. **Found** (short dashed line, brown color): This series rises slowly, starting from a low probability and only reaching approximately 0.25 even at the maximum number of searches. It indicates much lower effectiveness compared to the others.\n  \n4. **Accessed** (long dashed line, black color): Similar to \"Found,\" this series shows a very slow increase in probability, reaching only about 0.2 at the peak.\n\n5. **Parsed** (dot-dash line, grey color): This series remains fairly constant, showing little to no increase throughout the range of searches, indicating minimal effectiveness.\n\n### Legend:\nA legend is placed at the top left corner, clearly labeling each line with its corresponding search type.\n\n### Background and Style:\nThe background is a light color that enhances the visibility of the lines, and the gridlines are likely subtle, designed to aid in reading the plot without being intrusive. \n\nOverall, the graph effectively communicates how different search methodologies perform as the number of searches increases, with clear differentiation in the effectiveness of each methodology."
