  "PaperQA is a retrieval-augmented generative agent for scientific research that uses large language models to answer questions over the scientific literature, reducing hallucinations and providing provenance for answers. It outperforms existing models on science QA benchmarks and matches expert human researchers on a new benchmark called LitQA, which requires retrieval and synthesis of information from full-text scientific papers. PaperQA has three components: finding relevant papers, gathering text, and generating answers with references, and it exhibits a better knowledge boundary than competing tools, answering questions incorrectly at a lower rate.",
  "Scientists evaluate LLMs using QA benchmarks, but open-ended tasks require manual evaluation. Retrieval-Augmented LLMs, also known as RAG models, combine a database, query system, and pipeline to add retrieved documents to a model's context, and have been effective in biomedical and clinical QA tasks. RAG models can be improved with multi-hop searches, agents, and prompting, and use various retrieval methods, including fixed representations, pre-trained embeddings, and trainable encoders. The goal is to evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Models and determine under what conditions LLMs can match human performance in information retrieval.",
  "The PaperQA system is an agent that finds relevant papers, gathers text, and synthesizes information to answer questions. It uses external APIs and Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces four key innovations: decomposing RAG operations, using a map-reduce step, utilizing LLMs for text reasoning and relevance scoring, and using a priori and a posteriori prompting. The system has three tools: search, gather evidence, and answer question, which make use of three independent LLM instances to accumulate evidence and answer questions.",
  "The LitQA dataset is a benchmark for evaluating AI systems' ability to answer scientific questions based on retrieved information, consisting of 50 multiple-choice questions from the biomedical domain, sourced from recent literature, with 5-7 possible answers, and designed to be difficult or impossible to answer without retrieving the relevant paper.",
  "PaperQA outperforms existing commercial products and is on par with human experts in scientific question answering, with a low rate of incorrectly answered questions and low cost per question, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential as a tool for scientific research.",
  "PaperQA outperforms GPT-4 and other models in various question answering tasks, with a significant improvement in performance when using its search capabilities. The model does not hallucinate citations, unlike other LLMs. Ablation studies show that using multiple-choice options and Google Scholar improves performance. PaperQA also outperforms GPT-4 and AutoGPT on standard QA benchmarks, including PubMedQAblind, MedQA, and BioASQ, with the largest gap in performance on PubMedQAblind.",
  "GPT-4 and other models' performance on MedQA-USMLE, BioASQ, and PubMedQAblind benchmarks, with PaperQA and posteriori reasoning showing varying degrees of improvement. PaperQA achieves high accuracy and cost efficiency, with no hallucinated citations found, and works independently with various models. Limitations include reliance on correct information in research papers and potential impact of changing scientific literature. The PaperQA system aims to reduce hallucinations and accelerate scientific research by augmenting researchers with a literature review tool.",
  "List of 37 references in the field of natural language processing, language models, and recommender systems, including research papers, conference proceedings, and preprints from 1980 to 2023, covering topics such as language modeling, text retrieval, and scientific search.",
  "The text appears to be a list of references for a research paper on retrieval-augmented language models for clinical medicine, citing various studies and papers from 2017 to 2023 on topics such as language models, question answering, and biomedical text mining.",
  "The text appears to be a list of research papers and preprints related to large language models, their applications, and their potential uses in various fields such as biomedicine, science, and multimodal reasoning. The papers cover topics including language model architectures, retrieval-augmented models, biomedical knowledge bases, and the use of language models for scientific discovery and problem-solving.",
  "The appendix describes implementation details of PaperQA, including model versions, system prompts, and tool descriptions. It also evaluates paper retrieval using different search API engines, including Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and CORE API, and compares the performance of two LLMs, Claude-2 and GPT-4, in generating keywords and searching for papers. The evaluation metrics include recall, cumulative recall curve, and area under the curve, and the results show that Google Scholar and GPT-4 perform better in retrieving and parsing original papers.",
  "The provided text discusses the evaluation of language models, including their ability to search for and parse information, and their performance on question-answering benchmarks. It also examines the quality of discovered evidence and the impact of parametric knowledge on model responses, with examples showing the model's ability to recognize contradictions and provide informed answers when given relevant background information. The results show that the PaperQA model is competitive with ground-truth context and can provide complementary information, with AUC values ranging from 0.07 to 0.66 for different models and datasets."
