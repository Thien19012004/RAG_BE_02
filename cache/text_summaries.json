  "This paper, \"New Year's Day Speeches of Czech Presidents: Phonetic Analysis and Text Analysis,\" analyzes the speeches of Czech presidents on New Year's Day from 1935 to 2017. The authors, Milan Jičínský and Jaroslav Marek, used phonetic analysis to examine voice characteristics such as log energy, speech velocity, and Zero crossing rate, and identified words with the highest energy values. They also conducted text analysis to compute transcript characteristics like most frequent words, word length, and vocabulary richness. The study provides a new perspective on political speeches and can extract historically important information from available data.",
  "The article discusses the analysis of New Year's Day speeches by Czech presidents, focusing on phonetic analysis and its fundamentals. The main goal is to present words spoken with the greatest energy, which can indicate what the president emphasized during the speech. The analysis also includes speech velocity, which represents how fast the speaker talks. \n\nThe study uses voice characteristics such as intensity (energy) and zero-crossing rate (ZCR) to analyze the speeches. Energy is calculated as the sum of squared values of samples within a frame, and ZCR is a parameter that characterizes the changing of sign from negative to positive or back. \n\nThe results show that President Hácha spoke with lower energy, possibly due to the political situation during his time. President Husák's energy decreased significantly between 1978 and 1979. The ZCR values are typically low for voiced signals and higher for noises and unvoiced signals. \n\nThe study also calculates speech velocity, which represents how many words the speaker pronounces per second. The results show that President Husák's speech in 1989 was the slowest, and President Hácha also spoke relatively slowly. \n\nThe analysis can be useful for linguists, historians, and others interested in studying the language and emphasis used by Czech presidents in their speeches. The study provides insights into the individuality of each president's speech and how it reflects their personality, ideology, and the political situation of their time.",
  "The text analyzes the speeches of Czechoslovak presidents, Czech presidents, and Czechoslovak prime ministers from 1931 to 2011. The study examines the speech velocity, word length, and most frequent words used in the speeches. \n\nThe fastest speaking tempo was found in speeches from 1938, 1943, 1959, and 1996. The mean word length varied across presidents, with communist presidents (Zápotocký, Novotný, Husák) using longer words than modern presidents (Havel, Klaus, Zeman). President Beneš used the shortest words.\n\nThe most frequent words in the speeches were conjunctions and prepositions, with \"a\" being the most common in most speeches. Meaningful words differed significantly across presidents, reflecting their reactions to current events such as war, crisis, and the return of democracy. A comparison with inaugural speeches of US presidents is also mentioned.\n\nThe study used a software tool called \"Statistika v lexikální analýze\" to analyze the text parameters, including word length, frequent letters and words, and other features. The analysis provides insight into the language and style of the speeches, as well as the historical context in which they were delivered.",
  "The provided text appears to be a mixture of historical information, tables, and analysis of speeches by various Czech and Slovak leaders, including presidents and prime ministers. The text mentions several key figures, such as Edvard Beneš, Emil Hacha, Ludvík Svoboda, and Václav Havel, and discusses their roles and speeches during different time periods.\n\nThe text also references various years, including 1945, 1960, 1968, 1987, and 1993, which seem to be significant milestones in Czech and Slovak history. Additionally, the text touches on themes such as socialism, communism, and national development.\n\nThe latter part of the text appears to be an analysis of language richness in speeches, using metrics such as the number of words, different words, and word frequency. A scatter chart is mentioned, which is used to demonstrate vocabulary richness, and a Gompertz curve is referenced as a model for functional dependency.\n\nOverall, the text seems to be a collection of historical notes, analysis, and data visualization, but the exact purpose and context are unclear due to the disjointed and fragmented nature of the text.",
  "This article summarizes research on analyzing speeches by extracting words with the greatest energy, which can be used as keywords to characterize the speaker and their historical context. The study used an archive of 74 speeches, totaling over 19 hours of recordings, to calculate phonetic parameters such as zero-crossing rate (ZCR) and log energy. The results showed that the most frequent thematic words did not match the words pronounced with the greatest energy, indicating that speakers emphasized specific words to convey their message. The study provides insight into the speaking style and priorities of different presidents, such as Masaryk (economy), Beneš (war and humanity), Novotný (hard work and communism), and Havel (initial words \"Dear fellow citizens\"). The research demonstrates the potential of audio analysis to extract meaningful information from speeches without requiring a full listening."
