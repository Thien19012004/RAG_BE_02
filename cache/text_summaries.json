  "The article \"Pythagorean Theorem Before and After Pythagoras\" by Ravi P Agarwal discusses the origins and significance of the Pythagorean Theorem. The theorem, which states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse, is a fundamental concept in geometry and arithmetic. The article highlights the theorem's historical importance, with references to ancient mathematicians such as Euclid and Pythagoras, as well as later mathematicians who attempted to prove the fifth postulate, which led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe article also explores the theorem's applications in various fields, including discrete, combinatorial, and computational geometry, as well as its use in carpentry, navigation, and astronomy. The author notes that the theorem has been widely recognized and celebrated, with Nicaragua issuing a stamp commemorating the theorem and a survey ranking it as one of the most beautiful equations in science.\n\nAdditionally, the article touches on the theorem's connection to trigonometry, with the Pythagorean identities being a direct consequence of the theorem. The author also provides a brief etymology of trigonometric terms, such as sine, cosine, and tangent, which originated from Sanskrit and Arabic words.\n\nOverall, the article aims to appreciate the significance and beauty of the Pythagorean Theorem, which has had a profound impact on the development of mathematics and continues to be an essential concept in various fields.",
  "The text discusses the history of the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The theorem was known to various ancient civilizations, including the Chinese, Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Indians, with evidence of its use dating back to around 2500 BC. The theorem is named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who is often credited with its discovery, although it is likely that one of his followers proved it. The theorem has been proved in many different ways, with over 500 known proofs, and has been an important part of mathematics for centuries, with Euclid's Elements providing one of the most well-known proofs. The text also highlights the contributions of other mathematicians and philosophers, such as Al-Battani, Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni, and Thomas Hobbes, to the understanding and development of the Pythagorean Theorem.",
  "The text discusses the Pythagorean Theorem, its converse, and generalizations. The Pythagorean Theorem has been proven in numerous ways, with 371 proofs compiled by Elisha Scott Loomis in his book \"Pythagorean Proposition\". The converse of the theorem also holds, stating that if the square of one side of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the angle between those two sides is right. This converse has been proven in various ways, including one by Douglas Mitchell in 2009. The theorem can be used to determine whether a triangle is acute, right, or obtuse. A generalization of the theorem, known as Hippocrates's Generalization, states that the area of a figure on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of similar figures on the other two sides. This generalization applies to similar figures with curved boundaries and concave polygons.",
